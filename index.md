# Welcome to *Portals*

Portals is an extension of *Dataflow Streaming* for *Stateful Serverless*. 

## Highlights
Portals is designed for complex stateful serverless applications. 

#### Stateful Serverless 
Portals fully-automates the hard things with distributed applications.
* &#10004; Reliability 
* &#10004; Scalability 
* &#10004; Execution 

#### Extending Dataflow Streaming
Portals extends *Dataflow Streaming* to support common patterns in *Stateful Serverless*.
* &#10004; Dynamic Communication Topology 
* &#10004; Cyclic Dependencies 
* &#10004; Request/Reply with Futures 
* &#10004; Atomic State Updates 
* &#10004; Dataflow Composition

#### Portals Programming Model
The Portals programming model consists of *Atomic Streams*, *Workflows*, and *Portals*. To find out more about how everything fits together, check out the [Portals preprint](/preprint), or the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/portals-project).
