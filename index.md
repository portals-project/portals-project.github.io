# Welcome to Portals.

Portals is an extension of *Dataflow Streaming* for *Stateful Serverless*. It is a programming model and distributed system for building complex stateful serverless applications.

#### Stateful Serverless 
Portals fully-automates the hard things with distributed applications.
* &#10004; **Reliability** - Exactly-once processing guarantees.
* &#10004; **Scalability** - Scale up and down with demand; data-parallelism, task-parallelism.
* &#10004; **Execution** - Decentralized, cloud, edge, performance.

#### Extending Dataflow Streaming
Portals extends *Dataflow Streaming* to support common patterns in *Stateful Serverless*, harnessing the inherent scalability and reliability of dataflow streaming.
* &#10004; **Dynamic Communication Topology** - Dynamically evolving applications and communication topologies.
* &#10004; **Cyclic Dependencies** - Cycles, iterative computations.
* &#10004; **Request/Reply with Futures** - Ask/Await futures API.
* &#10004; **Atomic State Updates** - Live consistent updates on application state.
<!-- * &#10004; **Typed Communication** - The workflows and streams are typed. -->
<!-- * &#10004; **Dataflow Composition** - Composition in the style of dataflow streaming. -->
