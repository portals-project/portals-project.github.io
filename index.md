# Welcome to *Portals*

Portals is a framework written in Scala under the **Apache 2.0 license** for stateful serverless applications. It provides a Scala and a JavaScript API, its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/portals-project/portals). 

At its core, Portals unifies the Distributed Dataflow Streaming Model and the Actor Model, providing unparalleled flexibility and data-parallel processing capabilities with strong guarantees. The framework's programming model is tailored for edge stateful serverless processing. 

Find out more about what *Portals* is and how everything fits together on the [Learn](/learn) page, or check out our [Talks & Papers](/talks-&-papers), or at the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/portals-project). We also have an introductory [Tutorial](/learn/tutorial) for the Portals framework. Make sure to also try out our new [Playground](https://www.portals-project.org/playground/) which runs in the browser. Find out more about the project's team [here](/team).

### News
* Our paper *"Failure Transparency in Stateful Dataflow Systems"* was accepted at **[ECOOP 2024](https://2024.ecoop.org/)**. We will present the work in Vienna, Austria, this September. The pre-print is available on **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06738)**.
