# 2022: Retrospective, Highlights
These are some of our highlights of 2022.

## Portals
Portals started out of a research project we had previously called "Pods". The project started from reflections on the problematic combination of fault-tolerance and cyclic/dynamic communication patterns/topology. Around May, 2022, we started working on a *dataflow streaming* based model, targeting *stateful serverless applications*. The name *Portals* was later chosen, it refers to the *Portal* abstraction in the programming model.

## Workshops / Presentations / Posters
We presented the work at various workshops / poster-sessions. This included the event at *CASTOR Software days*, and more (see [talks and posters](/talks-&-papers)).
Here is a picture from the poster session at *CASTOR Software days*.

## Onward'22
Our work was accepted into Onward!'22 / Splash'22, and we got the chance to travel to Auckland, New Zealand, to present it ([see our trip blog post](/blog/onward-splash-22)). The paper is now freely available on [ACM DL](https://doi.org/10.1145/3563835.3567664), and the presentation is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyLNjtENti4).
